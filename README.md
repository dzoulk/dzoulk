<h2>Hi 👋, I'm Daniel</h2>

<p>
  I'm a second-year <strong>Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia</strong>
  with a strong interest in building reliable, well-designed software.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy learning how systems work under the hood and applying my knowledge through
  academic coursework and personal projects.
